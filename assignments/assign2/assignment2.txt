Task 1:
It would take 4 steps for the linear search to find the number 8.

Task 2:
It would take 1 step for the binary search to find the number 8.

Task 3:
Since the big O notation of binary search is O(log n), in the worst case scenario to search an array of size 100,000 would be log_2(100,000) steps or 17 steps.
