#### TASK 1 - Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it:
```
           11
        /      \
      10        8
    /    \     / \
  6       9   7   4
 / \     / \
2   1   3   5
```

#### TASK 2 - Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node.
```
          9
       /      \
      6        8
    /    \     / \
  3       5  7   4
 / \     
2   1   
```

#### TASK 3 - Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?
